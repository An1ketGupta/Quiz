# ðŸŽ¯ Quiz App

Welcome to the **Quiz App** â€” a fun and simple web-based quiz built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! No frameworks, no backend â€” just good old-fashioned front-end code.

- Styled with a clean, serif font and a soft shadowed container to make it easy on the eyes.

You can easily change the questions, add more, or even convert it to a timed quiz! Just edit the `index.html` and tweak the logic in `script.js`.
